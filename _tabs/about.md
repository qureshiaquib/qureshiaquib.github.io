Hi,

This is Aquib and welcome to my site Azure Doctor!

I work as Cloud Architect at Microsoft.
My job is to assist Enterprises to help them Architect, Configure, and Optimize their Microsoft Azure solutions.

This blog is a compilation of random things that Iâ€™ve learned and feel essential to refer back to in the future.

In this blog I share two category of post. First one namely tech-blog which is for Azure Admin/Architects with detailed walkthrough of the topic. 

The second type of post is Azure Shorts. This is for folks who're interested in learning quick tips that can help them improve their existing azure deployments.
Expect frequency of this type of post more than a complete tech-blog.
If you know something more about specific shorts which I post I invite you to comment on the post so others can benefit from your insights!

This is my small way to help the community.

Happy Learning!!
