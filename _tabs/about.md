Hi,

My name is Aquib and welcome to Azure Doctor!

I work as Cloud Architect at Microsoft. Have been in technology for more than a decade.
My job is to assist Enterprises to help them Architect, Configure, and Optimize their Microsoft Azure solutions.

This blog is a compilation of things that I’ve learned and feel essential to refer back to in the future.
This is my small way to help the community.

In this blog I share two category of post. 
* **Tech Blog** which is for Azure Admin/Architects with detailed walkthrough of the topic. 
* **Azure Shorts** This is for folks who're interested in learning quick tips that can help them improve their existing azure deployments.
